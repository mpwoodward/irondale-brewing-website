Round one of the brewery build-out photos! I'd never acid stained concrete before so it was a learning experience to be sure, but I'm really pleased with the way it came out!

Next steps are to finish out the cabinets, get the backsplash in, install the range hood, sink, faucet, some additional plumbing and electrical ... but it's coming along nicely.

Any day now I'll be brewing some beer!
