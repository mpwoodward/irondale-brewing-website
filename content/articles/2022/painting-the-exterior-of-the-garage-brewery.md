As part of the house remodel project we wound up doing more work ourselves than we may have wanted, partially to save a few (OK, many) bucks when we could, but mostly to keep things moving since finding people is difficult when all the tradespeople are so incredibly busy.

Since we *could* paint the outside of the garage/brewery we figured why not. It took a couple of days but we probably covered the cost of the brewery mini split with our time and kept things moving as well.
