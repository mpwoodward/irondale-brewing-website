Acid staining the concrete floor in the brewing space proved to be a very time-consuming process, but it's finally done and I love the results.

Despite all my painstaking masking and covering of the baseboards and walls, once the floor was totally done I did have to do quite a bit of touch-up painting where the stain seeped up onto the bottom of the baseboards, which between priming and multiple coats added quite a bit to the overall timeline. But hey, I couldn't not take a stab and making everything perfect!

I really love the almost leather look it has to it, and the slight imperfections in the concrete made for some really interesting veining.
