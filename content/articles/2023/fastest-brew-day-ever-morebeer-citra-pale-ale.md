I ordered <a href="https://www.morebeer.com/products/citra-pale-beer-brewing-kit-1-gallon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoreBeer's Citra Pale Ale kit</a> this summer but it kept getting bumped down the brewing list, so I took the opportunity this morning to finally knock this one out. And since it's partial-mash and only had a 30-minute boil, it was the fastest brew day I've ever had.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the all-grain brewing process as well, but there's something to be said for being able to whip up a batch in a total of a couple hours from start to cleanup.

Partial-mash brewing is also great for experimentation. If I just want to mess with a recipe or see how a particular addition might pan out, knocking an hour of mash time off the process is awesome. Then with a quick baseline in place I can build that out to an all-grain recipe later.

Quick brew day, quick post! We'll see how this one tastes in a few weeks. Cheers!
