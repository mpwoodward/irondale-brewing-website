The Irondale Brewing taproom got a big upgrade today with the arrival of a new <a href="https://komosdraft.com/products/komos-v2-kegerator-stainless-nukatap-faucets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Komos Four-Tap Kegerator</a>! This thing is a beauty and can hold up to four 5-gallon slimline or corny kegs.

There's a fair amount of assembly to do but since it has to sit for at least 24 hours after shipping to let the coolant settle, I took the opportunity to get the casters on the bottom and wheel it into place to get acclimated.

Since I brew nearly all small batches of 1 to 2.5 gallons I also ordered four <a href="https://www.morebeer.com/products/slimline-torpedo-ball-lock-kegs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.5-gallon Torpedo slimline kegs</a> to get things rolling. These don't arrive for about another week or so which should give me plenty of time to get the kegerator ready. And it's nice to know if I ever need 5-gallon kegs they'll fit in here just fine.w

Until now I've been using 1-gallon <a href="https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/northern-brewer-1-gallon-mini-keg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mini kegs</a>, each with their own <a href="https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/mini-co2-regulator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mini regulator</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LELAND-74G-2PK-Beverage-Cartridge-Threaded-Disposable/dp/B000V6EBQC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CO2 cartridge</a>, and either a <a href="https://www.williamsbrewing.com/Home-Brewing-Equipment/Kegging-Equipment/Beer-Faucets/Picnic-Tap-21-Low-Profile-Keg-Faucet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picnic Tap 2.1</a> or a <a href="https://www.williamsbrewing.com/Home-Brewing-Equipment/Kegging-Equipment/Beer-Faucets/Nukatap-Mini-Faucet-Shanks/Nukatap-Ball-Lock-Flow-Control-Mini-Faucet-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nukatap Mini</a>, and while this has been working OK, having everything centralized in a kegerator is going to be much more convenient. I'll also finally get to use my super cool Irondale Brewing tap handles.

More to come on this as I get it fully assembled and start pouring beer. Cheers!
