Tonight's holiday beer selection is Ignite the Lights Christmas Ale from <a href="https://www.ignite.beer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ignite Brewing</a>.

I'm not sure what to say about this one -- I'll explain -- but I'll do my best.

The highlight of this beer is the color. It's a gorgeous kind of ruby-reddish-brown, and I'm not sure I've seen a beer quite this color before. Kudos on that point.

From there it goes, well, not exactly downhill, but kinda nowhere. Carbonation was the only real flaw here, in that there was little to none and I poured pretty darn hard when I didn't see anything happening.

Aroma? It smells faintly of beer. Not hoppy, maybe just a tad malty and beer-like.

Flavor? For me it's entirely non-descript. It's one of the weirder beers I've had. The lack of carbonation was again a bit of a drawback, but I mean ... it just kinda taste beer-y. It's not too sweet, not noticeably bitter, mouthfeel is right down the middle, and if there are spices in here -- which according to the internet there are -- I sure didn't taste them in any notable way.

At 7.5% ABV it was definitely in the winter warmer arena, so I kept sipping on it, and I wasn't displeased, it was just kind of ... there. I've read reviews that said this was along the lines of Great Lakes Christmas Ale, but I got literally no cinnamon, ginger, or honey, so I'm not sure if I got a weird batch or an old can or what.

So yeah. That's my review. I had this beer, and other than the color it was unremarkable.

On to the next one!
