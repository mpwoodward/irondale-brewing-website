The last piece is finally in! The chimney took a ton of fiddling to get it attached but overall installing this wasn't too bad, particularly since our electrician attached the exhaust ducting to the roof vent when he was up there doing some wiring work.

And now, I can brew!

(Since I'm backfilling the blog I'll share that this thing isn't doing a great job handling condensation which may require me swapping it out for a condensate hood. Live and learn.)
