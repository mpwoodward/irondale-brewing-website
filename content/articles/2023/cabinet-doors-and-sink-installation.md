Summary: Quick update on the brewing space buildout progress -- the sink is in! My wife and I cut the hole in the countertop to drop in the sink, and then we could finally call the plumbers to come out and hook up everything including the Waterdrop RO filter and the under-sink hose bib for the wort chiller.

During this push I also got the cabinet doors installed and adjusted. I'm not sure I have photos of this specifically, but at some point during the buildout I added some edge banding from <a href="https://www.fastcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FastCap</a> that matches the Ikea cabinets, which eliminated the white of the inside of the cabinets showing around the doors and drawers.

Oh, and I got a couple of cool chairs.

Getting closer ...
