I recently dumped my <a href="https://craftbeerclub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Craft Beer Club</a> subscription I'd had for a couple of years (short version: it feels like they got bought and subsequently things went severely downhill) and changed over to <a href="https://www.beerdrop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beer Drop</a>, which I'm really loving so far. The fact that you can see what you're getting and swap stuff out is really great.

This <a href="https://crossroadsbrewingco.com/beers/brick-row-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brick Row Red</a> from Crossroads Brewing in Catskills, NY was in my first shipment from Beer Drop, and it's pretty solid. It's maybe just a tad sweet for what I tend to like in an amber ale (I tend to like ambers a bit more crisp/dry and just very slightly more bitter than this one, my favorites being Bell's, Mack & Jack's, and Alaskan Amber), and it's a bit on the lighter side in terms of the color with respect to the range for ambers.

Honestly if I think of it more as a red than an amber, it makes a lot more sense. But then I'd want it to be a bit more red. :)

Not a lot of hop aroma to speak of but there's just enough hop bite in the finish to keep it from being overly sweet, and I'll give it a lot of points for being super smooth and very drinkable. I may sound like I'm being nitpicky (because hey, why review beers if you're not going to pick them apart a little!), but it sure didn't last long in my glass!

The other thing I like about Beer Drop is you get two cans of whatever you pick, so I have another one to review my findings on another day.

Cheers!
