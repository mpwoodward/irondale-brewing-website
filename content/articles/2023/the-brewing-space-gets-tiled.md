Summary: I'd never tiled anything other than a pretty simple kitchen floor job a million years ago, but thankfully my wife is super experienced with this kind of work and provided not only guidance but a ton of hands-on assistance, not to mention the rallying cry of, "Let's go do your tile!" at just the right time.

I'd never tiled anything other than a pretty simple kitchen floor job a million years ago, but thankfully my wife is super experienced with this kind of work and provided not only guidance but a ton of hands-on assistance, not to mention the rallying cry of, "Let's go do your tile!" at just the right time.

Luckily we already had both a wet and dry tile saw, so I handled the basic dry cuts for the tiles that just needed to be less wide or tall, and I left the fancier cuts to my talented wife.

Once things had set for a couple of days I did the grout work, which was another first for me. YouTube definitely helped (how did anybody figure out how to do anything before YouTube?), but it also gave me a bit of a false sense of confidence since people who have done this hundreds of times make it look easy.

After the grout had set, some grout sealing and caulking finished things out.

For never having done this before I'm really pleased with the results! It was a ton of work, a lot of up and down (and long periods of standing) on a ladder, but worth it for the end result.

Next up, the range hood which I think is the final thing I need before I can start brewing.
