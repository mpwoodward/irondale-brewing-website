I'm trying this one a bit late but WOW is this great. Super rich and malty, sitting just this side of a Cascadian Dark Ale (or "Black IPA" for you non-Pacific Northwesterners), it's got a great balance of darker malts without getting astringent, and just enough hop aroma and bitterness to round things out.

And the ABV of "6.66%" is a nice touch even if it's not 100% accurate.

I highly recommend this one!
