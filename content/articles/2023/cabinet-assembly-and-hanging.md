Summary: I finally got the time to make a big push on assembling and hanging the Ikea cabinets. Overall this went pretty smoothly, again thanks to the experience and know-how of my wife, and probably also because we had just assembled a ton of Ikea cabinets as part of our house remodel.

I finally got the time to make a big push on assembling and hanging the Ikea cabinets. Overall this went pretty smoothly, again thanks to the experience and know-how of my wife, and probably also because we had just assembled a ton of Ikea cabinets as part of our house remodel.

Hanging the top cabinets proved to be the semi-tricky part since we had to plan pretty carefully and do a lot of math to make sure we were leaving exactly the right amount of space for the 30" range hood, and ideally get the upper cabinets the line up with the lower cabinets.

Yet another thing I'd never done before executed pretty well in the end.

Once all the doors and drawers are in, I think tiling the backsplash is next!
