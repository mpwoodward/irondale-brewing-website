This must be my favorite glass since it winds up in all the photos!

This is the end of a batch of "near-SMaSH" Pale Ale I brewed in August, and it came out great! I'm a huge fan of simple recipes like this: Pale 2-Row, a bit of Crystal 40, and Cascade hops (one of my favorites since I had my first had Sierra Nevada Pale Ale) at 60 minutes, 15 minutes, and flameout.

I tend not to make exactly the same recipe twice (there's *always* something to tweak), but this one may be worth repeating in a 5-gallon batch to have around for next summer.
