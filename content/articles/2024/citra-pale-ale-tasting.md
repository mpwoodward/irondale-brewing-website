After a week carbonating and conditioning in the keg, it was finally time to try the <a href="https://www.morebeer.com/products/citra-pale-beer-brewing-kit-1-gallon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoreBeer Citra Pale Ale kit</a> I [brewerd right before Christmas]({filename}../2023/fastest-brew-day-ever-morebeer-citra-pale-ale.md)).

To sum things up, I immediately regretted that this was only a 1-gallon batch. This stuff is absolutely amazing and it's almost criminal how quick and easy it was to brew to get these fantastic results.

As you can see in the photo it's a bit cloudy but I think that's mostly chill haze since as it warmed up a bit it was more clear, and I bet it'll clear up more with more time in the keg, if it isn't gone before it gets the chance. (Spoiler: it won't get the chance.) As it warmed a bit and in better lighting it had a really great golden/light orange color to it.

It doesn't have a huge head on it but the retention was good, with a nice white layer of foam on top the entire time I was drinking it.

The aroma is off-the-charts amazing. Huge fruity and floral waves come off the glass, with just a hint of wood/pine notes from the Northern Brewer hops.

The flavor is equally amazing. Very fruity without crossing the line into juice-bomb territory (looking at you, <a href="https://www.newbelgium.com/beer/voodoo-ranger-juice-force/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juice Force</a>), and a nice bitterness in the finish from the Northern Brewer hops. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with my only minor (and I do mean minor) nitpick being that it could maybe just be very slightly drier/crisper. But seriously, that's me looking for flaws in an otherwise amazingly tasty beer.

I will definitely make this one again, very soon, but will ramp the recipe up for a 2.5 gallon batch. I may also experiment with some different bittering hops and do an all-grain version for a third try.

A++ to MoreBeer for this one. Absolutely love it.

Cheers!
