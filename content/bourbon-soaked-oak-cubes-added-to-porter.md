I added the bourbon-soaked oak chips to the Porter I have going yesterday and not too long after it kicked off a bit of additional fermentation activity! I used Knob Creek 12 Year and 1/2 ounce <a href="https://www.morebeer.com/products/american-oak-cubes-stavin-medium-toast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medium plus toast American oak cubes</a>.

I'm planning on letting this go for 5 days and then either keg or bottle; I may bottle to let it condition for a while.

Can't wait to see how this one comes out! I did a Stout in similar fashion a few years ago that I really enjoyed but haven't tried this with a Porter.
