<a href="https://kulshanbrewing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kulshan Brewing</a> out of Bellingham, WA makes some of the consistently great beers in my part of the world but somehow I hadn't tried their <a href="https://kulshanbrewing.com/kitten-mittens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kitten Mittens Winter Ale</a> until this year, and between loving all their beers and the unconfirmed (but likely) reference to <a href="https://youtu.be/_dhrqnDS_oU?si=ZJekMjlmhfMkKf4M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a> (one of my favorite shows), I was excited to give this one a try.

Visually it's a gorgeous, deep, rich brown-black with a hint of dark red and has a light brown head that sticks around after the pour. The aroma is a rich mix of dark chocolate, toasty malts, some fig and plum notes, and maybe just a bit of vanilla as well.

Based on the look and smell of this beer, I think I'm going to love it.

And sure enough, the flavor is amazing. This is a rich (I've used that word a lot to describe this beer!), creamy beer, with the dark chocolate malts front and center but not at all bitter, an underlying bready note, and the roastiness of a porter or stout in the finish. It's very low in bitterness so you don't really think about the hops while drinking this beer, but they've done a fantastic job of using just enough to counterbalance the malt sweetness.

This is a really amazing beer. And in their taproom they DO IT ON NITRO so I better make the trek over there before it's gone for the year.

Kitten Mittens has immediately become one of my favorite holiday beers. I appreciate that it's "wintery" without resorting to the blatant use of Christmas spices that often goes terribly wrong (at least for me). It's a creamy, hearty, absolutely delicious beer that's perfect for this time of year.
