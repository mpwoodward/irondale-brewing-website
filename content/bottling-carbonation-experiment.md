Since I started brewing again I've been using one-gallon kegs, but when I did a quick batch of Northern Brewery's <a href="https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/festivus-miracle-small-batch-ale-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Festivus Miracle</a> a few weeks ago I bottled in swing-top bottles thinking I'd share with neighbors for the holidays.

Well, not only did it not carbonate, but I wound up very much not liking the beer anyway, so it got dumped. No great loss, and I'll be doing a <a href="https://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/christmas-ale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great Lakes Christmas Ale</a> clone later this week for which I have high hopes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

The thing that irritated me more than the taste of the beer was the fact that it didn't carbonate. I used carbonation drops, which I've used a lot in the past and never had an issue, but since I'm planning on bottling some of the next Christmas Ale both to share and to potentially take to a homebrew club in January, I figured I better figure out my bottling situation because there is nothing more disappointing than waiting for a beer to finish bottle conditioning only to find it didn't carbonate.

A couple of years ago I had another batch (also a holiday ale, coincidentally) that didn't carbonate in the bottle and I was able to rescue it using <a href="https://www.lallemandbrewing.com/en/united-states/product-details/lalbrew-cbc-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lallemand CBC-1</a> after the fact, which was a bit of a hassle. I suppose if I wanted to guarantee carbonation in the bottle I could pre-emptively make CBC-1 part of the bottling process to begin with but I also don't want bottle bombs, so ... this is why kegging wins on this point.

But, certainly for beers that need to age for a bit like high-gravity beers, bourbon barrel whatever, bottling is a great way to do so I got to thinking it'd be good to have a solid bottling process that removes as much chance from the equation as can be removed.

## Carbonation Failure Theories

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The couple of other times in the past I've had bottle-conditioned beers fail to carbonate, the first was a high-ABV bourbon and oak infused stout (pushing 10%), and the other was the aforementioned holiday ale that wasn't particularly high ABV (maybe 6.5% if I remember correctly), but it had cherries and honey in the mix.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In both cases, my best guess there is I pitched enough yeast to have it ferment, but maybe there simply wasn't enough residual yeast to eat the priming sugar and carbonate the beer.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The other potential cause in the case of the bourbon stout is the bottles themselves. I used swing-top bottles and perhaps they weren't fully sealed and the carbonation escaped as it was being generated. I don't believe the gaskets themselves were the issue since they were brand-new at the time of that batch, but it's another potential cause of failure.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the case of the holiday ale I actually used 500 ml PET bottles so the bottle and lids weren't the issue; my best guess there is lack of residual and/or tired yeast due to the inclusion of fruit and honey.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It's also entirely possible I didn't wait long enough, but I kept bottles of the bourbon stout around for 2-3 months and while the flavor was quite good, the carbonation just never happened.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Lastly, two other things crossed my mind as potential issues:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

<ol>

<!-- wp:list-item -->

</p>

<li>

I cold crash my batches, usually for 48 hours. Everything I've read indicates this does not negatively impact bottle carbonation and that you just have to wait a bit longer for the yeast to become re-activated, but the potential impact of cold crashing crossed my mind.

</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<li>

The use of carbonation drops versus table sugar or some other kind of sugar. When I was brewing quite a bit a couple of years go before taking a break while working on the new brewing space I used carb drops nearly exclusively and didn't have any issues other than with the couple of batches I mentioned, but it's another variable.

To summarize the theories:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

<ol>

<!-- wp:list-item -->

</p>

<li>

Not enough residual yeast to carbonate

</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<li>

Bad gaskets or seal on flip-top bottles

</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<li>

Didn't wait long enough

</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<li>

Carb drops don't work as well as table sugar

</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

</ol>

So, let's set up this experiment and see what we can learn.

## The Sacrificial Batch

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the purposes of this experiment I happened to have a second batch of this year's <a href="https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/smash-sensory-blonde-ale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn to Homebrew Day recipe</a>. I made the first batch using RO water and some additions, and for the second batch I used tap water and added 1/4 campden tablet. My tap water is pretty noticeably chlorinated when it's not filtered, so I was curious to give this a shot and see what the differences are between two otherwise identical batches.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When the tap water batch was done fermenting I thought I'd potentially sacrifice it as part of the experiment to hopefully get to the bottom of potential carbonation issues when bottle conditioning.

## The Experiment

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To test my various theories, I decided to cold crash for 48 hours and bottle as follows:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table -->

<figure class="wp-block-table">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Number of Bottles</td>
<td>Bottle Size and Type</td>
<td>Carbonation Method and Amount</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>16-ounce swing-top</td>
<td>1.5 carbonation drops</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>16-ounce swing-top</td>
<td>1 tsp table sugar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>12-ounce long-neck, bottle-capped</td>
<td>1 carbonation drop</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>12-ounce short-neck (Anchor Steam bottle), bottle-capped</td>
<td>3/4 tsp table sugar</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>

<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I also replaced the gaskets on the swing-top bottles with new silicone gaskets to remove the possibility of old/worn gaskets being the issue.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I'm going to let all the bottles condition at 68 degrees F for a full two weeks before chilling a couple to see where things stand.

Hate to end on a teaser, but check back in a couple of weeks for the preliminary results of both this experiment, and the result of the taste test between RO water with additions versus tap water with campden!

(Yeah, I know, terrible scientific method here with changing multiple variables and trying to squeeze multiple things into one experiment. I do what I can.)
